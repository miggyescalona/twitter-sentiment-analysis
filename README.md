UPITDC - Twitter Sentiment Analysis

Used JSON to parse each tweet gathered from the Twitter server and display them back in a page the same manner on how a tweet is displayed with the usual Twitter feed.

On each tweet, there is an analysis whether it is in a positive, negative or neutral mood. The mood is displayed through the use of Smileys/Emoticons. 

A corpus that contains words together with their rates are used to determine a tweetâ€™s mood. This corpus has been used by many data scientists as an instrument for them to quantify the mood of a tweet.

Due to file size limits, the complate data.json file is in a compressed folder and should be unzipped. 
Otherwise, the smaller version of the data is used by default.
